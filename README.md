For each data set, your project will be evaluated as follows:

<ul>

 <li> You will get more points for larger/messier data sets:

  <ul>

   <li>0-5 pts &lt;30K o 6-10 pts &gt;=30K</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li> Data cleaning:

  <ul>

   <li>provide a link where you found the data</li>

   <li>describe what steps you had to do for data cleaning (more points for messier data that needed cleaning)</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li> Data exploration:

  <ul>

   <li>use at least 5 R functions for data exploration o create at least 2 informative R graphs for data exploration</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li> Run at least 3 ML algorithms on each data set, <strong>using at least 5 algorithms</strong> in all.

  <ul>

   <li>this portion of your R script should include:

    <ul>

     <li>code to run the algorithms</li>

     <li>commentary on feature selection you performed and why</li>

     <li>code to compute your metrics for evaluation as well as commentary discussing the results</li>

    </ul></li>

   <li> Run at least one ensemble method such as Random Forest, XGBoost o this portion of your R script should include:

    <ul>

     <li>code to run the algorithms</li>

     <li>commentary on feature selection you performed and why</li>

     <li>code to compute your metrics for evaluation as well as commentary discussing the results</li>

    </ul></li>

   <li> Results analysis o rank the algorithms from best to worst performing on your data o add commentary on the performance of the algorithms

    <ul>

     <li>your analysis concerning why the best performing algorithm worked best on that data</li>

     <li>commentary on what your script was able to learn from the data (big picture) and if this is likely to be useful</li>

    </ul></li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

Project depth o 0-3 project minimally meets requirements o 4-6 project exceeds minimum requirements o 7-10 project went well above the requirements
